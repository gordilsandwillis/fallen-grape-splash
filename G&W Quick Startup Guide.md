## Out of the Box Block Types
- ATF (Above the Fold)
- CenterAlignedText
- Fifty Fifty (Image and Text or Video)
- Two Up Images
- Two Up Text

## Import Fields
The out of the box block types correspond to contentful fields. For easy setup, we have an import file that you can import to your new blank Contentful space.
The file is included in the repo â€” `TBD BlocksToContentful.json`

To speed things up further, this import will also create a `Page` content model, as well as a `SiteSettings` model to be used across the site.
